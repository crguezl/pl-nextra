## Currying in Egg

When the argument used to index a function object is not an attribute of the function 

```ruby 
someFun[arg1, ... ] # and "arg1" is not a property of "someFun"
```

then we want `arg1, ...` to be interpreted as arguments for `someFun` and the expression returns the [currying of the function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying) on `arg1, ...`. 

For instance:

```ruby
✗ cat examples/curry-no-method.egg        
print(+[4](2))
```

In this version of the Egg interpreter `+` is a function that takes an arbritrary number of numbers:

$$+: \cup_{i=1}^{\infty}\mathbb{R}^i \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$$

and returns its sum. The curried $+[4]: \cup_{i=1}^{\infty}\mathbb{R}^i \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the function defined by $+[4](x_2, \cdots, x_n) = +(4, x_2, \cdots, x_n)$.

Here is the implementation of the arithmetic operations in this version of the Egg interpreter that take an arbritrary number of numbers:

```javascript
// arithmetics
[
  '+', 
  '-', 
  '*', 
  '/', 
  '**',
].forEach(op => {
  topEnv[op] = new Function('...s', `return s.reduce((a,b) => a ${op} b);`);
});
```

Execution:

```
➜  egg-oop-parser-solution git:(master) ✗ bin/eggc.js examples/curry-no-method.egg 
➜  egg-oop-parser-solution git:(master) ✗ bin/evm examples/curry-no-method.json 
6
```

However, if the attribute exists we want an ordinary property evaluation, as in this example:

```ruby
➜  egg-oop-parser-solution git:(master) cat examples/function-length-property.egg
do(
    def(f, fun(x, y, +(x,y))),
    print(f["numParams"]) # JS length property is not supported
)
➜  egg-oop-parser-solution git:(master) ✗ bin/egg examples/function-length-property
2
```

We have added an attribute `numParams` to the Egg Function objects that returns the number of parameters in its declaration.

**Design Consideration**

The decision of overloading the meaning of the property access for functions is a risky one
but has few consequences over the grammar design. 

**The decision of overloading the meaning of the property access for functions has consequences during the interpretation phase**.
    
In this case the idea behind the proposal is that 

**Any potential argument of a function can be viewed as a property of such function whose value is the function curried for that argument**

which makes the design proposal consistent with the idea of **property**

## Currying and the dot operator

The *dot operator*  for objects `a.b`  is defined in such a way that `a.b` and `a["b"]` are the same thing. This is why the former program can be rewritten this way:

```
➜  egg-oop-parser-solution git:(master) ✗ cat  examples/curry-no-method-dot.egg
```
```ruby 
print(+.4(2))
```
```                                                                       
➜  egg-oop-parser-solution git:(master) ✗ bin/egg examples/curry-no-method-dot 
6
```
