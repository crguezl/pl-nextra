**Danger: Exponentiation is ECMAScript 2016**

New Features in ECMAScript 2016:  JavaScript Exponentiation (**)
See for instance: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_2016.asp and https://262.ecma-international.org/7.0/

> ...   This specification also includes support for **a new exponentiation operator** and adds a new method to Array.prototype called **includes**

Since escodegen does not support this Feature the combination of unary minus and exponentiation currently does not work.

```js

Therefore, the following  continuation of the former node session suggest the correct translation:

<Callout>
```js copy
> let ast5 = espree.parse('Math.pow(-2,2)')
undefined
> gc = escodegen.generate(ast5)
'Math.pow(-2, 2);'
> eval(gc)

```
