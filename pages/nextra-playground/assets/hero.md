# Hero Section

The **hero section** is a large, prominent area at the top of a web page, often the first thing visitors see when they land on a site. It is designed to capture attention, communicate the primary message or purpose of the site, and set the tone for the rest of the page.

On an e-commerce website, the hero section might showcase a featured product, with a headline like *Discover the Latest Collection* and a Call-to-Action (CTA) button to *Shop Now*.

### Key Characteristics of a Hero Section

1. **Large Visual Element**:
   - Hero sections often feature a bold image, video, or graphic background that spans the full width of the viewport.
   - The visual often aligns with the brand or page content, adding emotional impact or visual appeal.

2. **Main Headline or Tagline**:
   - Typically, a hero section includes a headline or tagline that summarizes the purpose of the website or page.
   - This headline is usually prominent and serves to quickly convey the brand's message or product benefit.

3. **Call-to-Action (CTA)**:
   - A key component of most hero sections is a **call-to-action button** or link, prompting users to take action, such as "Sign Up," "Learn More," or "Shop Now."
   - The CTA is designed to guide users towards a specific goal or conversion.

4. **Supporting Text**:
   - Hero sections often include a short paragraph or subheadline that offers a bit more detail about the headline or reinforces the message.

5. **Full-Width and Bleed**:
   - Hero sections are often designed to be full-width (bleeding to the edges of the screen) to create a sense of immersion.

### Purpose of a Hero Section
The hero section is used to quickly convey a siteâ€™s value proposition or introduce users to its purpose. It helps improve user engagement by making a strong first impression, encouraging users to explore further.
