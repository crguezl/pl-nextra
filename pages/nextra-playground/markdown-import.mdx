## Markdown Extended Importing

The following mdx code:

```mdx
import TaskList from '../pl-includes/task-list.mdx'
 
<TaskList />
```
Where the file `'../pl-includes/task-list.mdx'` contains:

```mdx
- [x] Code
- [x] Sleep
- [ ] Eat
```

Inserts the markdowm file in `'../pl-includes/task-list.mdx'` into the page and looks like this:

import TaskList from '../pl-includes/task-list.mdx'
 
<TaskList />
