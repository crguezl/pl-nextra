## getStaticProps

With Next.js, you can pre-render your page using [Static Generation (SSG)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended). Your pages will be generated at build time and statically served to visitors. It can also be cached by a CDN to maximize the performance.

This is supported by Nextra too. See section [Next.js SSG](https://nextra.site/docs/guide/ssg).
