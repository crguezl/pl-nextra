import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

import { useData } from 'nextra/data'
 
export const getStaticProps = ({ params }) => {
  return fetch(`https://api.github.com/repos/shuding/nextra`)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(repo => ({
      props: {
        // We add an `ssg` field to the page props,
        // which will be provided to the Nextra `useData` hook.
        ssg: {
          stars: repo.stargazers_count
        }
      },
      // The page will be considered as stale and regenerated every 60 seconds.
      revalidate: 60
    }))
}
 
export const Stars = () => {
  // Get the data from SSG, and render it as a component.
  const { stars } = useData()
  return <strong>{stars}</strong>
}
 
[Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra) has <Stars /> stars on GitHub!

The  output above was produced by this code:

```jsx
import { useData } from 'nextra/data'
 
export const getStaticProps = ({ params }) => {
  return fetch(`https://api.github.com/repos/shuding/nextra`)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(repo => ({
      props: {
        // We add an `ssg` field to the page props,
        // which will be provided to the Nextra `useData` hook.
        ssg: {
          stars: repo.stargazers_count
        }
      },
      // The page will be considered as stale and regenerated every 60 seconds.
      revalidate: 60
    }))
}
 
export const Stars = () => {
  // Get the data from SSG, and render it as a component.
  const { stars } = useData()
  return <strong>{stars}</strong>
}
 
Nextra has <Stars /> stars on GitHub!
```

## Version 3 Update

In version 3 of Nextra `useData` was moved to `nextra/hooks`:

```jsx
import { useData } from 'nextra/hooks'
```


## getStaticProps

With Next.js, you can pre-render your page using [Static Generation (SSG)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended). Your pages will be generated at build time and statically served to visitors. It can also be cached by a CDN to maximize the performance.

This is supported by Nextra too. See section [Next.js SSG](https://nextra.site/docs/guide/ssg).

<Callout type="info"> 
If you export a function called `getStaticProps` (Static Site Generation) from a page, 
Next.js will pre-render this page at build time using the `props` returned by `getStaticProps`.
</Callout>
