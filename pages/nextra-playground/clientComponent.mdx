### `ClientComponent` code

The code of the `ClientComponent` is shown below:

```jsx
'use client'

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

const catURL=  "https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search?size=full"
const fetcher = () => fetch(catURL).then((res) => res.json())

async function fetchData() {
  // Simulate an API call
  let cat = await fetcher()
  return cat[0]
}

function DataFetcher() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    setData(await fetchData()) //.then(setData)
  }, [])

  if (!data) return null

  return <img src={data.url} width={data.width} height={data.height} />
}

export default function ClientComponent() {
  return (  
    <div>
      <DataFetcher />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Functional Components Life Cycle 

There are 3 phases in the React Component LifeCycle:

<Callout type="info">
1. Mounting Phase
2. Updating Phase
3. Un-Mounting Phase
</Callout>

## useEffect hook

The `useEffect` is a Hook in React that allows you to perform side effects in function components. 
Side effects can include 

- data fetching, 
- subscriptions, or 
- manually changing the DOM. 

### Basic Syntax

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Side effect code
  return () => {
    // Clean up code (optional)
  };
}, [dependencies]);
```


1. The first argument is a function that contains the side effect code.
2. The return function is for cleanup (optional).
3. The second argument is an array of dependencies (optional).

### Phases and the useEffect hook

After the component is rendered React will run all `useEffect` hooks defined in that component.

During the **mounting phase**, a functional component is being created and added to the DOM. 
In this phase, you typically initialise **state** and perform any setup thatâ€™s needed when 
the component is first **rendered**. 
The `useState` hook allows you to add **state** to your functional components. 
You can initialise **state** and retrieve the current value and a function to update it.

In the **updating phase**, the functional component is re-rendered due to changes in its props or state. 
By using the `useEffect` hook without a dependency array, 
the provided function will run on every render.

In the **unmounting phase**, the functional component is being removed from the DOM. 
By returning a *cleanup function* from the `useEffect` hook, you can specify 
cleanup operations to be performed when the component is unmounted.

### Key points to remember about `useEffect`

- Effects **run after every render** by default. Specifying a **dependency array** allows you to control when the effect runs.
- The **cleanup function** (returned by the effect) runs **before the component unmounts** and before the effect runs again on re-renders.
- If you're using an object or function as a dependency, be careful about recreating it on every render, as this can cause unnecessary effect runs.
- Avoid updating state in an effect without a dependency array, as this can cause infinite loops.
